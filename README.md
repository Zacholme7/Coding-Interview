# Coding Interview Preparation

## Overview
This repository is dedicated to my journey of preparing for coding interviews. It includes exercises and solutions from different coding platforms and educational resources such as LeetCode, NeetCode, and TakeUForward.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized into directories for each coding platform or resource:

- `/LeetcodeDaily` - Daily practice problems from LeetCode.
- `/Neetcode` - Solutions to problems curated by the NeetCode collection.
- `/TakeUForward` - Practice based on the TakeUForward series with daily updates.
- `/Util.cpp` - Utility functions used across various coding problems in C++.

Each directory may contain additional README files with more detailed information about the exercises and my progress.

## Daily Routine
My daily routine includes solving at least one problem from any of the listed resources and pushing the solution to this repository. This helps me stay consistent and track my progress over time.

## Usage
The purpose of this repository is personal development. However, it can serve as a reference for other aspiring software engineers who are preparing for their coding interviews. Feel free to explore the solutions and the thought processes behind them.

## Contributions
While this is a personal development repository, I'm open to discussions, suggestions, and feedback. If you notice any bugs or have alternative solutions, feel free to open an issue or a pull request.
